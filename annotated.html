		<dt><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/761849.761859">Job characteristics and quality of working life in the IT workforce: the role of gender.</a></dt>
		<dd><p>For this paper, the researchers conducted a secondary data analysis of web-based questionnaire survey that was collected from a sample of 1,278 employees of a single organization.  The study was done to determine the relationship between job and organizational factors, on one hand, and quality of working life and turnover intention. The results show that gender had no impact on quality work life.  The results also show that high work pressure is related to low job satisfaction for women, but not for men. Women IT workers who report high levels of task significance also report high job strain, and this is unique to women IT workers. The limitations of the study include the cross-sectional nature of the data, the use of an existing database to perform secondary analyses, the different sample sizes for various groups, and the organization only being in the public sector.</p></dd>
		<dt><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2015.1063584">Occupational gender stereotypes and problem-solving in Italian adolescents</a></dt>
		<dd><p>This study was mainly  aimed towards determining how Italian adolescents perceive new and traditional jobs in the market form a gender-stereotypes and gender-segregated view; The researchers also determined whether any gender-stereotyped view observed would be associated with traditionally gender-linked career interests.  The results show that IT jobs, such as software engineer and webmaster, were seen as masculine gender-stereotyped and masculine segregated. It was also found that gender-stereotyped and gender-segregated occupations were linked to the adolescents’ career interest.  The limitations of the study: there were more occupations stereotypically considered masculine in the questionnaire, the participants were only residents of Northeast-Italy, and only high school adolescents were involved in the study.</p></dd>
		<dt><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471772717300556">The influence of gender, and race/ethnicity on advancement in information technology</a></dt>
		<dd><p>In this article, the research was focused on understanding the experiences of women of different races/ethnicities in the technology workforce. To be specific, the study examined the role of gender and race/ethnicity in women’s career progression, if any.  The results support the existing research on women’s career barriers. The study shows that women were not all the same, and this created different experiences.  The various types of organizations and IT environments was another factor that greatly affected their advancement journeys.  Overall, the research shows the complexity of women’s advancement in IT.  The researcher also recommends senior leaders to embrace the complexity of workforce diversity and inclusion issues, and that they should consider obstacles through that unjustly hinders women in the IT workforce. The main limitation of the study was not being able to generalize the findings even though this was not the intent. The factors that contributed to this is the small sample size of women who met the criteria, difference in geographical areas and types of organizations, and not so evenly distributed sample (particularly the number of Asian American and Hispanic American/ Latina women may reveal factors not found in this study). </p></dd>
