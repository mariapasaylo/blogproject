		<dd><p>The image was an advertisement for a computer company. According to Marie Hicks, a technology historian, they used women in the adverts to give the “appearance to managers that jobs involving computers are easy and can be done with a cheap labour force,” but women were actually “skilled computer programmers, minus the prestige or pay the modern equivalent command” (Brewer, 2017). I think this image shows the severity of sexism. Instead of showing the product they used women to sell their product. Stereotypes that women’s jobs are easy and cheap form the “basis of sexism,” which “refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.258).  Women were not as valued as men. Through the media, the idea that feminine jobs are ‘easy’ is implied. It is also stated in the ad also say the ‘this is all the staff you need’. I think that this is one of the main reasons for the wide gender gap in tech. This labeling of women as less than males reminds me of the Thomas Theorem, wherein “people’s behaviours can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.85).  This advertising strategy is still prevalent today. Researchers have found that “media (advertising in particular) promotes gender stereotypes” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.171). During this time, computer programming was seen as feminine. An example of this is an article about “Grace Hopper who famously compared programming to planning a meal” (McGee,2018).  I think it is interesting how the stereotype of people in tech shifted to a complete opposite today.</p></dd>

		<dd><p>This is a cartoon where a woman fixes a computer while a man is in shock (Hicks, 2010). I think this is a great example of deviance which “is a violation of established contextual, cultural, or social norms” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.136). The gender stereotypes are broken through this act of defiance. This shows that women can do what society labels as a man’s job. Even though the women are doing a man’s job they still show that they are doing gender. I think that the bobby-pin is a way of showing that “we are always ‘doing gender’” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.261). The shock in the man’s face shows that gender stereotyping does exist. According to the U.S. department of Commerce Report, this stereotype is “one reason for the gender gap which acknowledges the bias toward men as keepers of technology” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p.171). The cartoon portrays the opposite of what we expect. I think that this can be empowering to women. </p></dd>
