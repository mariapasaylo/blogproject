	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Learn about the role of gender in the workplace of software engineers. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.aacc.edu/about/administrative-offices/honors-program/">Honors Program</a>, and this website is for an Honors Project for an Introduction to Sociology Course at <a href="https://www.aacc.edu/">AACC</a>. </p>
	<h2>Guidelines for Online Sources</h2>
	<p>These guidelines are from Stuart Greene and April Lidinsky's <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Inquiry_to_Academic_Writing_A_Pract.html?id=ZYdCDwAAQBAJ">From Inquiry to Academic Writing A Practical Guide Fourth Edition</a>. Here are the guidelines I used for assessing the trustworthiness of online sources:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><span class="pop">Evaluate the Author of the Site.</span> If the author's name appears on a website, ask the following: Who is this person? What credentials and professional affiliations qualify this person to make a legitimate argument in the field being investigated? </li>
		<li><span class="pop">Evaluate the Organization that supports the Site.</span> Look at the domain name. The .edu extension means the site is associated with a university or college, which gives it credibility. The same holds true for .gov, which indicates a government agency. Both types of sites have regulatory body that oversees their content. The extension .org indicate a non-profit organization; com. a commercial organization. Approach these websites with a degree of skepticism because you cannot be sure that they are carefully monitored by a credentialed regulatory bodies.</li>
		<li><span class="pop">Evaluate the Purpose of the Site.</span> Information is never objective, so whenever you evaluate a book, an article, or a website, you should consider the point of view of the writer or sponsor is taking. It is especially important to ask if there is a particular bias among members of the group that sposors the site. Can you tell what the sponsors of the site advocate? Are they hoping to sell or promote a product, or to influence opinion?</li>
		<li><span class="pop">Evaluate the Information on the Site.</span> You need to evaluate the extent to which the information is recent, accurate, and consistent with information you find in print sources and clearly regulated websites. You should check  further into some of the links, reading the sources cited and keeping in mind the four criteria for evaluating claim &mdash; recency, relevance, reliability, and accuracy.</li>
