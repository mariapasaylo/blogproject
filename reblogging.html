		<dd>The author, Marie Hicks, talks about the prevalence structural gender discrimination in the tech industry today through Google’s Gender Manifesto. Even though Google fired the person who wrote this manifesto, Google refused to “provide statistics on how it paid its women workers in comparison to men” (Hicks, 2017).  Her blog post reflects the lingering impacts of gender stereotypes. The study on occupational gender stereotypes of Italian adolescents show that IT jobs, such as software engineer and webmaster, were seen as masculine gender-stereotyped and masculine segregated (Ginerva & Nota, 2017). Her blog post also matches the study about implicit bias in information technology. The results of the study show that there is “evidence of an implicit association between new technology and masculinity in studies of attitudes toward computers and, in general, to technologies in modern society”(Elsbach & Stiligani, 2019).This is evident in the example she gave about a Google engineer asking her whether “women’s biological differences made them innately less likely to be good engineers” (Hicks, 2017). Overall, the blog revolves around the history of technology. I think that target audience of the posts are students and people in tech. I think that the intended research did not sway how the issue was reported because it matches the sociologists’ findings on this topic. I think this post is trustworthy not only because it matches sociologists finding, but it also references other sources and she has a specialized background in studying the history of computing, labor, and gender. For these reasons, I would steer a reader in search of information on this topic to this post. </dd>

		<dd>The author, Lily Chen, talks about her personal experience in tech and suggests reason for her experience. Her experiences align with sociologists’ findings on how “lack of mentors and role models as structural barriers at the advancement stage” (McGee, 2018). She had doubts about her capabilities as a software engineer, and she believes this is because of the lack of female mentors or role models (Chen, 2018). Another study  found that “women, who are accessing technology shaped primarily by male users, feel less confident in their Internet skills and have less Internet access at both work and home” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 158) . This study also supports the doubts she had about her capabilities. I think that this article is aimed towards other female software engineers. This site is a tech blog. Even though she does not have as much references as the other blog I reviewed.  I would say that it is a trustworthy source because her experiences align with the results sociologists found. However, I would not initially steer the reader in search of information on my topic to this post. </dd>
