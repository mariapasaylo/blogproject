		<dd>
		<p>This is a documentary about the gender gap in technology.  It explores the reasons behind the gap, consequences of the lack of diversity, and the possible solutions. Not only do they show the reasons why women and minorities are not going into tech, but also why women are leaving tech. A variety of women who are software engineers were interviewed about their experience in tech. Most of them faced discrimination in the workplace, and even in college; Some of their professors even told them that they did not fit (Hauser,2015). They also asked children what they think about people in the tech industry. Most of them pictured an anti-social Caucasian man with glasses (Hauser, 2015). </p>
		<p>There is no doubt that there is a lack of women in tech. I think that schools are mentioned in the film because it is one of the root causes. Schools play a big part in this because they are one of the major agents of gender socialization (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 258). The documentary shows how people in the school age perceived software engineers. Their results match the occupational gender stereotypes of Italian adolescents where the results show that IT jobs, such as software engineer and webmaster, were seen as masculine gender-stereotyped and masculine segregated (Ginerva & Nota, 2017). One of the girls from a group of teens in the documentary who took an introductory course says that most of the students were male and most of them already knew the topic (Hauser,2015). The documentary points out the effects of these gender stereotypes on the gender gap.</p>
		<p>Female software engineers in the documentary often felt being in the out-group, especially in college.  Usually the classes would be male dominated. One of the women talked about the guys in the class teaming up and working together while she was left to work alone. This makes it harder for the women in tech to enter the in-group because these in-groups “may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 119). The first female software engineer at Github had to leave because of the discrimination in the workplace. She began to receive threats even after she left work. This is similar to the cases in the study about the influence of gender, race/ethnicity on advancement in information technology. The study did not have an overall general finding, but the results supported the existing research on women’s career barriers (McGee, 2018). However, one female software engineer from STRAVA did not have the same experiences. She is the only female in a group of 35 male software engineers. This matches the study done on the role of gender in the IT workforce where the studies’ results say that gender had no impact on quality of work life (Carayon et al, 2003). </p>
		<p>The documentary also had clips of a TV series called Silicon Valley. The media is another one of the four major agents of gender socialization (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 259). This is an example where the media enforces the stereotype of software engineers. The documentary also talks about ‘brogrammers’ who are a mix of a stereotypical frat boy and software engineer in attempt to make it cool (Hauser, 2015). Another female software engineer at Pinterest was told that she should do a different job and that this made her feel like she was out of place because the people assumed that she would not be a software engineer (Hauser, 2015). She also believes that even though tech wants to be a meritocracy, which “is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort that determine social standing,” it isn’t one (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 188; Hauser, 2015).   This is similar to the findings of implicit bias in information technology. The researchers found evidence that there is an “implicit association between new technology and masculinity,”  and other studies have shown that women exposed to negative stereotypes “were more likely to attribute failure in performing a computer task to their own inability than did men”. (Elsbach & Stiligani, 2019).</p>

		<dd>
		<p>This is one of the episodes from a documentary series called Explained. The episode focuses on the history of coding and its prevalence in today’s world. It also points out the small percentage of people who know how to code. I think that the historical background is a good balance between genders because it talks about Charles Babbage and Ada Byron. According to the episode, Ada Byron was actually the one who “saw [the analytical engine’s] world-changing potential way beyond Math” (Klein & Posner, 2019). The study on the influence of gender, and race/ethnicity on advancement in information technology also talks about Ada and her critics who say that “her intellectual contributions are exaggerated, and the researcher states that these criticisms “provide an early example of challenges aimed at women’s competency and normative assumptions about men’s capabilities” (McGee, 2018). </p>
		<p>I noticed that most of the tech representatives were men. Most of them fit the stereotypical software engineer.  The sociologist in the episode points out that “there are a lot of White and Asian guys in programming” and that “we should expand who gets to be in that design room.”  This is similar to the results of implicit bias in information technology that new information technology tends to be a masculine domain (Elsbach & Stiligani, 2019).  From a feminist theorist’s perspective, which “is a type of conflict theory that examines inequalities in gender-related issues”, the difference in gender in the workplace can be seen in the inequal representation in this episode (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 261).</p>
		<p>I think that the underlying consequence of the diversity in tech has great consequences. An example of this is the woman in the episode with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and her pacemaker defibrillator, which is a “device that runs on code” and it is designed to shock when it detects a dangerous rhythm such as a palpitation, shocked her when she was pregnant because they didn’t consider that “about a quarter of all women have palpitations” (Klein & Posner, 2019).  This result is evident because based on a study done on women’s advancement in information technology “women represented 25% of the U.S. IT workforce … [and] 9% of global senior IT leadership” (McGee, 2018). The lack of representation lead to a major consequence in the product. The lack of representation of women lead to a major consequence inflicted on the users of the product.</p>
		<p>Especially with new technologies emerging such as machine learning. We need a more diverse workplace so that all conditions can be considered. The sociologist gives an example about a “criminal-justice system that has structural racism built into that data” while programmers are diverse” the machine will still learn from the data (Klein & Posner, 2019).Implicit bias is also a concern in one of the studies. They also reported that “recent research in computer science has confirmed that as machines acquire human-like language abilities… they also absorb implicit biases concealed within the patterns of language use” (Elsbach & Stiligani, 2019). From a conflict theorist’s view, these “social problems are created when dominant groups exploit or oppress subordinate groups” (Griffiths et al, 2016, p. 260). In this scenario, the male dominated tech industry makes it harder for women to be a part of it. </p>
